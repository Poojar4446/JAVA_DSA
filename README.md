Welcome to my **Java DSA** repository! 🚀 This repository documents my end-to-end journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** from scratch. Here you will find raw source code, optimized solutions, and notes on various DSA topics.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized by topic. Each folder contains the implementation of the data structure or algorithm along with practice problems.

🗺️ Learning Roadmap & Checklist
I am tracking my progress here.
Phase 1: The Basics
[ ] Introduction (Flowcharts, Pseudocode)
[ ] Time & Space Complexity (Big O Notation)
[ ] Basic Math for DSA (GCD, LCM, Primes)
[ ] Recursion Basics

Phase 2: Linear Data Structures
[ ] Arrays (1D, 2D, Sliding Window)
[ ] Strings (Immutability, StringBuilder)
[ ] Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
[ ] Stacks (Array & LinkedList implementation)
[ ] Queues (Deque, Circular Queue)

Phase 3: Sorting & Searching
[ ] Linear & Binary Search
[ ] Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sort
[ ] Merge Sort & Quick Sort
[ ] Cyclic Sort

Phase 4: Non-Linear Data Structures
[ ] Trees (Binary Trees, Traversals)
[ ] Binary Search Trees (BST)
[ ] Heaps & Priority Queues
[ ] HashMaps & HashSets
[ ] Tries

Phase 5: Advanced Algorithms
[ ] Greedy Algorithms
[ ] Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver)
[ ] Dynamic Programming (1D, 2D DP)
[ ] Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim's, Kruskal's)...
